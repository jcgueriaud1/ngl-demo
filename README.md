# Demo to integrate NGL Viewer in a Vaadin project

A simple demo to integrate [http://nglviewer.org/](http://nglviewer.org/) in a Vaadin project.

The JS files of NGL used during the run are from CDN.

To access it directly from github, clone the repository and import the project to the IDE of your choice as a Maven project. You need to have Java 8 or 11 installed.

Run using `mvn jetty:run` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in the browser.

If you want to run your app locally in the production mode, run `mvn jetty:run -Pproduction`.
